					<td>Well I had the opportunity to see Godzilla Minus One and I am ready to talk things through.

I have to say that this is probably the most decent and yet amazing Godzilla film of all-time and I definitely rank it as my number one favorite along with Final Wars and the original from 1954.
<br>
Here's the top 3 things that made me enjoy the movie even more.
<br>
1: The story and acting: I have to say that the story was very well-planned out which made it feel like a homage to the first Godzilla film. Even the acting is indeed to be considered top notch and spot on, and it is the best acting that you get from previous films in the series.
<br>
2: The characters: Of course, the one character that everyone roots for is obviously the King of the monsters, but there's a couple of human characters that you'll actually begin to like throughout the film. For example, there's a male character named Shikishima who was once a former Kamikaze pilot in WWII, and two female characters such as ≈åishi and Akiko who both lost their families duringng the bombings of Tokyo which even makes the film more enjoyable.
<br>
3: The design of Godzilla and Godzilla himself: As much as I love the numerous incarnations of Godzilla, I'd have to say that the new design seemed a fresh new start for Toho to begin with. I even liked how they reuse some the roars from the first film but maybe they could have at least updated the roar. Even the first few minutes where Godzilla attacks the soldiers on Odo Island is actually quite a cinematic spectacle.
<br>
To wrap things up, Godzilla Minus One is a cinematic monster blockbuster that die-hard Godzilla fans are actually dying for. Gonna give this 5 stars.</td>

WOW! Just WOW! This has got to be one of the greatest movies I've ever watched. I watched this movie with my friends and we LOVED IT! This movie is just 2 hours of excellence and very exciting. There are 3 things that really made this movie enjoyable.
<br>

1. The Animation
<br>
The animations in this movie are beyond excellent! The hidden details in the movie are just amazing. Once you find those hidden details, it makes you like this movie even more. I even like how they made The Spot go into the live action Venom Universe This just really amazed me.
<br>
2. The Soundtrack
<br>
The soundtrack in this movie is amazing. Metro Boomin really outdone himself with this soundtrack. The music really made this movie enjoyable and fit in perfectly with the action scenes. My favorite song in this soundtrack is Annihilate. Overall, this soundtrack is good but I still think that the Into The Spider Verse soundtrack is better.
<br>
3. The Characters
<br>
The characters were my favorite part of the whole movie. The Spider People were the best characters. My favorite was Spider Man India. As an Indian, he was so relatable. I liked how there were two villains in the movie. The Spot was such a funny villain and was really amazing. Spider Man 2099 was an okay villain and he was really serious on almost everything. My favorite part of the whole movie is when the Spider People did the pointing meme. I laughed so hard. Overall the characters were downright amazing.</td>
